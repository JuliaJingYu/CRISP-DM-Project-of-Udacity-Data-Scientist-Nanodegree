## Installation 

In order to run the codes, please use the libraries avaialble in Anaconda distribution of Python. The codes should be run with Python verion 3.0 or above. 

## Project Motivation 

For the project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data from 2019 in order to understand: 

1. As a developer, should I go to work in North America (e.g. America, Canada) or in Western Europe (e.g. France, Spain, Germany, Italy etc.)? 
2. What is the salary difference in North America and in Western Europe?
3. How are the programmers satisfying about their career between these two sides of the environment? 
4. Are there more job opportunities in the N.A. than that in Western Europe? 
5. What are the work hour differences in N. America and in Western Europe? 

## File Descriptions 

The Jupyter Notebook here presents the work related to answering the questions above. 

Raw survey data and survey questionnaires files are provided in the Kaggle link below under the section of Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgement. 

Specifically, these files are: 
1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name
3. so_survey_2019.pdf - PDF file of survey instrument


## Results

The main findings of the code is reported at the Medium post available here: [https://medium.com/@juliajingjun.yu/should-you-find-a-developer-job-in-north-america-or-western-europe-cfe905d89af6?sk=d372aa534ac88699d9bbceea92d6e62c].
